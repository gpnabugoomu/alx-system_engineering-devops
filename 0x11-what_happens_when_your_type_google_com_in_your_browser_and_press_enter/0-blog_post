When you kind https://www.Google.Com into your browser and press Enter, a complex collection of occasions is precipitated to retrieve and show the asked net web web page. This process includes more than one additives of the net stack, each gambling a essential function in delivering the final content material material. Let’s walk thru each step in detail:
1. DNS Request

The first step is resolving the area call www.Google.Com into an IP cope with. This is wherein the Domain Name System (DNS) comes into play:

    Browser Cache: The browser first assessments its cache to look if it has these days resolved the area.
    Operating System Cache: If the browser cache doesn’t have the facts, the running system’s cache is checked.
    DNS Resolver Cache: If the OS cache is empty, the request is despatched to a DNS resolver (regularly furnished through the use of your ISP).
    Recursive DNS Query: The DNS resolver starts offevolved querying the DNS hierarchy, starting with the muse DNS servers, followed by the TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers, and sooner or later the authoritative DNS servers for google.Com.
    IP Address Returned: The authoritative server for Google returns the IP address associated with www.Google.Com.

2. TCP/IP Connection

With the IP deal with obtained, your browser wishes to set up a connection with the server hosting the net website online:

    TCP Handshake: The browser initiates a TCP connection with the server the usage of the 3-manner handshake approach:
        SYN: The browser sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
        SYN-ACK: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-renowned) packet.
        ACK: The browser sends an ACK (widely known) packet decrease lower back to the server, putting in the relationship.

3. Firewall

During this connection method, firewalls on each the customer and server facets take a look at the packets:

    Client-Side Firewall: Ensures that outgoing visitors out of your tool is allowed.
    Server-Side Firewall: Inspects incoming web page visitors to make certain it’s allowed to reap the internet server. If any of those packets are deemed malicious, the firewall can block them.

Four. HTTPS/SSL

Given that the URL uses HTTPS, SSL/TLS encryption is needed to stable the communique some of the browser and the server:

    SSL/TLS Handshake: This technique includes:
        Certificate Exchange: The server sends its SSL certificate to the browser.
        Certificate Verification: The browser verifies the certificate closer to trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
        Session Keys: Both the browser and server generate consultation keys to encrypt the verbal exchange.

Five. Load Balancer

Before engaging in the real internet server, the request can also bypass through a load balancer:

    Distributing Load: The load balancer distributes incoming requests throughout a couple of servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
    Health Checks: Continuously video display units the health of servers and routes traffic only to healthful ones.

6. Web Server

The load balancer forwards the request to one of the available web servers:

    Handling Request: The internet server (e.G., Apache, Nginx) techniques the request, identifying if it can serve the asked aid straight away or if in addition processing is needed.
    Static Content: If the requested useful resource is a static document (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), the net server retrieves it from the document device and sends it again to the browser.

7. Application Server

For dynamic content material, the net server forwards the request to an software program server:

    Processing Request: The utility server (e.G., Node.Js, Django) runs the important application not unusual feel, possibly interacting with different services or databases.
    Generating Response: It strategies the facts, runs the vital code, and generates the dynamic content (e.G., a customized homepage).

8. Database

If the utility commonplace experience requires records storage or retrieval, the software program server interacts with a database:

    Query Execution: The software server sends SQL queries (or specific kinds of queries) to the database server (e.G., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    Data Retrieval: The database approaches the queries and returns the requested records to the utility server.
    Data Processing: The software server uses this data to assemble the very last reaction.
